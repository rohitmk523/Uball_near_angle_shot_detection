# Algorithm V3 Implementation

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Version:** enhanced_multi_factor_v3  
**Based on:** Misclassification Analysis of Games 2 & 3

## 🎯 Implemented Physics-Based Fixes

### Fix 1: Enhanced Rim Bounce for Steep Entries ✅
**Target:** Reduce False Positives by 50% (~8 cases)

**Implementation:**
```python
# Physics: Made shots with steep entry (>70°) should NOT bounce upward
steep_entry_bounce_back = (
    entry_angle is not None and entry_angle >= 70 and 
    post_hoop_analysis['ball_bounces_back']
)
```

**Logic:**
- If ball enters at steep angle (≥70°) AND bounces back upward
- Override classification to "missed"
- Reason: `steep_entry_bounce_back`
- Confidence: 0.85

**Justification:**
- Physics-based: Gravity pulls made shots downward, not upward
- Steep entries (>70°) that bounce back hit the rim and bounced out
- Observed in 8/16 false positives (50%)

**Risk:** VERY LOW - Fundamental physics constraint

---

### Fix 2: Enhanced Downward Continuation Weight ✅
**Target:** Improve confidence for strong downward trajectories

**Implementation:**
```python
downward_consistency = post_hoop_analysis.get('downward_consistency', 0)

if post_hoop_analysis['ball_continues_down'] and downward_consistency >= 0.8:
    # Very strong downward = higher confidence
    outcome = "made"
    decision_confidence = 0.88  # Boosted from 0.82
```

**Logic:**
- Check downward consistency (percentage of frames moving downward)
- If ≥80% consistent downward movement → boost confidence
- Applied to multiple decision factors:
  - Perfect overlap cases (3+ frames at 100%)
  - Fast swoosh cases (weighted score ≥3.5)
  - Moderate overlap cases (4+ frames at 95%)

**New Outcome Reasons:**
- `perfect_overlap_continues_down_strong` (confidence: 0.88)
- `fast_swoosh_clean_strong` (confidence: 0.75)
- `moderate_overlap_strong_downward` (confidence: 0.70)

**Justification:**
- Strong consistent downward movement is a reliable indicator
- Distinguishes clean makes from rim touches
- Physics-based: Made shots don't change direction

**Risk:** LOW - Adds nuance to existing indicator

---

### Fix 3: Fast Clean Swish Detection ✅
**Target:** Reduce False Negatives by 50% (~10 cases)

**Implementation:**
```python
# NEW Decision Factor 3b: Fast Clean Swish
elif frames_with_100_percent >= 2 and not is_rim_bounce:
    downward_consistency = post_hoop_analysis.get('downward_consistency', 0)
    
    if post_hoop_analysis['ball_continues_down'] and downward_consistency >= 0.8:
        outcome = "made"
        outcome_reason = "fast_clean_swish"
        decision_confidence = 0.75
```

**Logic:**
- Lower threshold from 3 to 2 frames at 100% overlap
- REQUIRES: Strong downward continuation (≥80% consistency)
- Must NOT be a rim bounce
- Confidence: 0.75 (conservative)

**Justification:**
- Very fast shots (swishes) may only appear in 1-2 frames
- Strong downward continuation confirms the ball went through
- Observed in 10/17 false negatives (59%)

**Risk:** MEDIUM - Conservative threshold (0.8) prevents false positives

## 📊 Expected Impact

### Conservative Projection
- **False Positive Reduction:** 50% (8 cases) → +4 correct classifications
- **False Negative Reduction:** 40% (7 cases) → +3.5 correct classifications
- **Total Improvement:** ~7-8 shots → **+3-4% accuracy gain**
- **Target Accuracy:** 86-90% (up from 83.14%)

### By Game
| Game | Current Accuracy | Projected Accuracy | Expected Gain |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Game 3 | 86.92% | 89-91% | +2-4% |
| Game 2 | 79.35% | 83-86% | +3-6% |
| **Average** | **83.14%** | **86-88%** | **+3-5%** |

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Modified Function
- `ShotAnalyzer._finalize_shot_sequence()` in `shot_detection.py`

### Lines of Code Added
- ~40 lines total
- Fix 1: 5 lines
- Fix 2: 25 lines (spread across multiple decision factors)
- Fix 3: 10 lines

### Detection Method Identifier
- Changed from `enhanced_multi_factor_v2` → `enhanced_multi_factor_v3`
- Allows tracking performance differences between versions

### New Outcome Reasons
1. `steep_entry_bounce_back` - Physics-based rim bounce
2. `perfect_overlap_continues_down_strong` - Strong downward with 3+ frames
3. `fast_clean_swish` - Fast shot with 2 frames + strong downward
4. `fast_swoosh_clean_strong` - Weighted score + strong downward
5. `moderate_overlap_strong_downward` - Moderate overlap + strong downward

## ⚖️ Overfitting Assessment

### NOT Overfitting ✅
All three fixes are physics-based and generalizable:

1. **Gravity:** Objects don't move upward without force
2. **Trajectory Consistency:** Smooth trajectories indicate clean entry
3. **Speed Variance:** Fast objects can be captured in fewer frames

**Evidence:**
- Based on 33 misclassifications across 2 different games
- Patterns consistent across both games
- Grounded in basketball physics

**Validation:**
- Will test on opposite camera angle (different perspective)
- Should work for any basketball court/camera setup
- Not tuned to specific game conditions

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Validation on Same Games
1. Re-run Game 3 Near Left (game_id: a3c9c041-6762-450a-8444-413767bb6428, angle: LEFT)
2. Re-run Game 2 Near Left (game_id: c07e85e8-9ae4-4adc-a757-3ca00d9d292a, angle: RIGHT)
3. Compare with baseline (v2) results
4. Expected: +3-4% accuracy improvement

### Phase 2: Validation on Opposite Angle
1. Run Game 3 Near Right (same game_id, angle: RIGHT)
2. Validate that improvements hold from different perspective
3. Check for any angle-specific issues

### Phase 3: Error Analysis
1. Analyze remaining misclassifications
2. Identify any new patterns
3. Determine if further improvements are possible
4. Assess need for dual-camera integration
