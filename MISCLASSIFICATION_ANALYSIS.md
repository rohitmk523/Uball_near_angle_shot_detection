## ‚ùå Pattern 1: False Positives (Detected "Made" but Actually "Missed")

### Characteristics (16 shots total)

**Common Indicators:**
1. **Ball bounces back after hoop interaction** (8/16 = 50%)
   - Entry angle: Often very steep (70¬∞-87¬∞)
   - Rim bounce confidence: 0.4 (moderate)
   - Post-hoop: Ball bounces back upward
   - **These are rim hits that bounced out**

2. **Good overlap but shallow entry angle** (5/16 = 31%)
   - 3-5 frames at 100% overlap
   - Entry angle: <30¬∞ (shallow approach)
   - Rim bounce: 0.3-0.4 (moderate)
   - **Ball goes through hoop area but doesn't drop**

3. **Perfect overlap with moderate rim bounce** (3/16 = 19%)
   - 3-4 frames at 100% overlap
   - Entry angle: 16¬∞-40¬∞
   - Rim bounce: 0.3-0.4
   - **Ambiguous cases**

### Example False Positives

**Game 3, Shot at 180.2s:**
- Detected: `made` (perfect_overlap_steep_entry)
- Ground Truth: `missed` (4PT_MISS)
- **Problem:** 5 frames at 100% overlap, steep entry (69.7¬∞), but ball didn't continue down
- **Why it failed:** Rim bounce confidence too low (0.1), didn't detect bounce-back

**Game 2, Shot at 351.9s:**
- Detected: `made` (perfect_overlap_steep_entry)
- Ground Truth: `missed` (3PT_MISS)
- **Problem:** 3 frames at 100%, very steep entry (85.1¬∞), ball bounces back strongly
- **Why it failed:** Rim bounce confidence only 0.4, post-hoop shows strong upward movement but wasn't weighted enough

---

## ‚ùå Pattern 2: False Negatives (Detected "Missed" but Actually "Made")

### Characteristics (17 shots total)

**Common Indicators:**
1. **Fast clean swish with low overlap** (10/17 = 59%)
   - Only 1-2 frames at 100% overlap
   - Entry angle: Often very steep (60¬∞-89¬∞)
   - Ball continues down: TRUE
   - Rim bounce: 0.0-0.3
   - **Ball passed through cleanly, too fast to capture**

2. **Off-center makes with low overlap** (5/17 = 29%)
   - 0 frames at 100% overlap
   - Max overlap: <85%
   - Ball continues down: TRUE
   - **Ball entered off-center but still made it**

3. **Incorrect rim bounce detection** (2/17 = 12%)
   - Low overlap (0-23%)
   - Rim bounce confidence: HIGH (0.9)
   - **Actually made but system thought it bounced out**

### Example False Negatives

**Game 3, Shot at 860.8s:**
- Detected: `missed` (insufficient_overlap)
- Ground Truth: `made` (3PT_MAKE)
- **Problem:** Only 2 frames at 100%, but ball continues down strongly
- **Why it failed:** Threshold too strict, didn't weight "continues_down" enough

**Game 2, Shot at 185.9s:**
- Detected: `missed` (rim_bounce_detected, 0.9 confidence)
- Ground Truth: `made` (3PT_MAKE)
- **Problem:** Very low overlap (23%), high rim bounce confidence
- **Why it failed:** Ball probably hit rim on entry but still went in (bank shot or rim roller)

## üéØ Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Rim Bounce False Positives (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Steep entry angles (70¬∞-87¬∞) with ball bounce-back are being classified as "made"
- **8 cases** where ball bounced back after going through hoop area
- Current rim bounce confidence (0.4) not high enough to override
- Post-hoop bounce-back indicator not weighted strongly enough

**Impact:** 50% of false positives

### Issue 2: Fast Clean Swish False Negatives (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Very fast shots (1-2 frames at 100% overlap) classified as "missed"
- **10 cases** where ball went through cleanly but too fast
- Current threshold requires 3+ frames at 100%
- Ball continues down indicator not weighted enough to compensate

**Impact:** 59% of false negatives

### Issue 3: Entry Angle Ambiguity (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Shallow entry angles (<30¬∞) are ambiguous
- **5 cases** with good overlap but shallow entry
- Hard to distinguish between "through the hoop" vs "past the hoop"
- May require dual-camera to resolve definitively

**Impact:** 31% of false positives

### Issue 4: Off-Center Makes (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Balls entering off-center (not through exact hoop center) get low overlap
- **5 cases** with <85% overlap but ball made it
- Overlap calculation assumes center entry
- "Continues down" indicator should boost confidence more

**Impact:** 29% of false negatives

## üîß Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Enhanced Rim Bounce Detection for Steep Entries ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Target:** Reduce False Positives by ~50%

**Current Logic:**
```python
if is_rim_bounce and bounce_confidence >= 0.6:
    outcome = "missed"
```

**Proposed Fix:**
```python
# Enhance rim bounce detection for steep entries with bounce-back
if entry_angle >= 70 and post_hoop_analysis['ball_bounces_back']:
    # Very steep entry + bounce back = likely rim bounce
    effective_bounce_confidence = max(bounce_confidence, 0.7)
    if effective_bounce_confidence >= 0.6:
        outcome = "missed"
        reason = "steep_entry_bounce_back"
```

**Justification:**
- Steep entries (>70¬∞) should NOT bounce back if made
- Physics-based: made shots continue downward
- **Not overfitting**: This is a legitimate physics constraint

**Risk:** LOW - Physics-based rule

---

### Fix 2: Fast Clean Swish Detection ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Target:** Reduce False Negatives by ~50%

**Current Logic:**
```python
elif frames_with_100_percent >= 3 and not is_rim_bounce:
    # Additional checks for confidence
    outcome = "made"
```

**Proposed Fix:**
```python
# Lower threshold for fast clean swishes
elif frames_with_100_percent >= 2 and not is_rim_bounce:
    # Check for strong downward continuation
    if post_hoop_analysis['ball_continues_down'] and 
       post_hoop_analysis['downward_consistency'] >= 0.8:
        # Fast clean swish
        outcome = "made"
        reason = "fast_clean_swish"
        confidence = 0.75
    elif frames_with_100_percent >= 3:
        outcome = "made"
        confidence = 0.80
```

**Justification:**
- 2 frames at 100% + strong downward movement = likely made
- Physics-based: made shots don't change direction after hoop
- **Not overfitting**: Uses trajectory physics

**Risk:** MEDIUM - Could increase false positives if not careful

---

### Fix 3: Enhanced Post-Hoop Analysis Weight ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Target:** Improve confidence for ambiguous cases

**Current Logic:**
```python
if post_hoop_analysis['ball_continues_down']:
    outcome = "made"
    confidence = 0.82
```

**Proposed Fix:**
```python
# Boost confidence for strong downward continuation
if post_hoop_analysis['ball_continues_down']:
    downward_strength = post_hoop_analysis['downward_consistency']
    
    if downward_strength >= 0.8:
        # Very strong downward = almost certain made
        outcome = "made"
        confidence = 0.88
    elif downward_strength >= 0.6:
        outcome = "made"
        confidence = 0.82
    else:
        # Weak downward, need more evidence
        pass
```

**Justification:**
- Strong consistent downward movement (80%+) is strong indicator
- Weak downward movement (<60%) shouldn't boost confidence
- **Not overfitting**: Uses trajectory consistency

**Risk:** LOW - Adds nuance to existing indicator

---

### Fix 4: Shallow Entry Angle Penalty ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Target:** Reduce false positives from shallow angles

**Proposed Fix:**
```python
# Penalize shallow entry angles for "made" classification
if outcome == "made" and entry_angle is not None and entry_angle < 25:
    # Very shallow entry, need stronger evidence
    if not post_hoop_analysis['ball_continues_down']:
        outcome = "missed"
        reason = "shallow_entry_insufficient_evidence"
        confidence = 0.65
```

**Justification:**
- Shallow entries (<25¬∞) are more likely to go past hoop, not through
- Requires downward continuation to confirm
- **Moderate risk of overfitting**: This is camera angle dependent

**Risk:** MEDIUM-HIGH - May be camera-angle specific

## ‚öñÔ∏è Overfitting vs. Legitimate Improvement Analysis

### ‚úÖ Legitimate Improvements (Recommended)

**Fix 1: Enhanced Rim Bounce for Steep Entries**
- **Physics-based:** Made shots don't bounce back upward
- **Generalizable:** True for all basketball shots
- **Evidence:** 8/16 false positives fit this pattern
- **Verdict:** NOT overfitting ‚úÖ

**Fix 2: Fast Clean Swish (with strong downward check)**
- **Physics-based:** Made shots continue downward
- **Generalizable:** True for all clean swishes
- **Evidence:** 10/17 false negatives fit this pattern
- **Safeguard:** Requires 80%+ downward consistency
- **Verdict:** NOT overfitting ‚úÖ

**Fix 3: Enhanced Post-Hoop Weight**
- **Physics-based:** Trajectory consistency is meaningful
- **Generalizable:** True for all shots
- **Adds nuance:** Doesn't change core logic
- **Verdict:** NOT overfitting ‚úÖ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Overfitting (Caution)

**Fix 4: Shallow Entry Penalty**
- **Camera-dependent:** Entry angle calculation depends on camera position
- **May not generalize:** Different camera angles will have different "shallow" thresholds
- **Sample size:** Only 5 cases
- **Verdict:** POSSIBLE OVERFITTING ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Recommendation:** Wait for more data OR test on opposite camera angle first
