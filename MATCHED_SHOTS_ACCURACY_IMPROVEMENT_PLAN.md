# Matched Shots Accuracy Improvement Plan

## ðŸ“Š **Current Situation Analysis**

Based on mismatch analysis report (lines 60-72):

**Total Outcome Mismatches: 78 cases**
- **Made â†’ Missed: 47 cases** (made shots incorrectly classified as missed)
- **Missed â†’ Made: 31 cases** (missed shots incorrectly classified as made)

**Current matched_shots_accuracy issues:**
- **insufficient_overlap: 24 times** â†’ Made shots with moderate overlap classified as missed
- **perfect_overlap_steep_entry: 22 times** â†’ Missed shots with steep entry and high overlap classified as made
- **perfect_overlap_layup: 9 times** â†’ Missed shots with layup-like overlap classified as made
- **fast_clean_swish: 8 times** â†’ Fast missed shots classified as made
- **steep_entry_bounce_back: 6 times** â†’ Made shots with bounce-back classified as missed
- **perfect_overlap: 6 times** â†’ Missed shots with perfect overlap classified as made

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Analysis**

### **Issue 1: Made Shots Classified as Missed (47 cases)**

**Root Causes:**
1. **insufficient_overlap (24 cases)**: Made shots with 30-55% average overlap are rejected
   - Current logic requires 3+ frames at 100% or strong downward continuation
   - Many made shots have moderate overlap but still go in
   - Example: 30.7% overlap, 0 frames at 100%, 88Â° entry angle â†’ classified as missed

2. **steep_entry_bounce_back (6 cases)**: Steep entry (>70Â°) shots with bounce-back classified as missed
   - Current logic treats steep entry bounce-back as rim bounce (miss)
   - But some made shots with steep entry can show slight bounce-back
   - Need better distinction between rim bounce vs slight bounce on made shot

3. **Low overlap threshold too strict**: System is too conservative for made shots
   - Requires 6+ frames at 100% OR (4+ at 100% AND 7+ at 95%) for high confidence
   - Many valid made shots don't meet this threshold
   - Especially affects shots with 50-70% average overlap

**Sample Pattern:**
- Overlap: 30-55%
- Frames with 100%: 0-2
- Entry angle: 20-90Â°
- Classification: MISSED (but actually MADE)

---

### **Issue 2: Missed Shots Classified as Made (31 cases)**

**Root Causes:**
1. **perfect_overlap_steep_entry (22 cases)**: Steep entry angles (>40Â°) with high overlap classified as made
   - Current logic: `entry_angle >= 40` â†’ classified as made
   - But steep entries can hit rim and bounce out (miss)
   - Example: 66.4% overlap, 3 frames at 100%, 19Â° entry â†’ classified as made

2. **perfect_overlap_layup (9 cases)**: Layup-like patterns classified as made
   - High overlap (80-100%), multiple perfect frames
   - But ball can still miss (rim out, bounce out)
   - Need better rim bounce detection

3. **fast_clean_swish (8 cases)**: Fast shots with strong downward continuation classified as made
   - Current logic: 2+ frames at 100% + strong downward â†’ made
   - But fast missed shots can also have strong downward movement
   - Need additional validation beyond downward continuation

**Sample Pattern:**
- Overlap: 66-100%
- Frames with 100%: 3-7
- Entry angle: 6-86Â°
- Rim bounce confidence: 0.0-0.7 (low)
- Classification: MADE (but actually MISSED)

## âœ… **Improvement Plan**

### **Phase 1: Fix Madeâ†’Missed Errors (47 cases)**

#### **Improvement 1.1: Lower Threshold for Moderate Overlap Made Shots**

**Problem**: Made shots with 30-55% overlap are rejected

**Solution**: Add special handling for moderate overlap with consistent trajectory

**Implementation**:
```
Current: Requires 3+ frames at 100% for made classification
New: If 50-70% avg overlap + consistent downward movement + no bounce-back â†’ MADE
```

**Decision Logic Addition**:
- If `avg_overlap >= 50%` AND `avg_overlap < 70%`:
  - Check for consistent downward movement (downward_consistency > 0.7)
  - Check for no bounce-back (upward_consistency < 0.3)
  - If both true â†’ Classify as MADE with confidence 0.70-0.75
  - Reason: "moderate_overlap_consistent_downward"

**Expected Impact**: Fix 15-20 of 24 "insufficient_overlap" cases

---

#### **Improvement 1.2: Improve Entry Angle Consideration for Made Shots**

**Problem**: Steep entry angles (70-90Â°) with moderate overlap are too strict

**Solution**: Adjust threshold based on entry angle

**Implementation**:
```
For steep entries (>70Â°): Lower overlap requirement
- Steep entries naturally have less overlap but can still go in
- Current: Same threshold for all angles
- New: Steep entries need lower overlap threshold
```

**Decision Logic Addition**:
- If `entry_angle >= 70Â°` AND `avg_overlap >= 40%`:
  - Require: downward_consistency > 0.6 AND no rim bounce
  - If true â†’ Classify as MADE with confidence 0.72-0.80
  - Reason: "steep_entry_clean_swish"

**Expected Impact**: Fix 5-8 of remaining "insufficient_overlap" cases

---

#### **Improvement 1.3: Better Rim Bounce vs Made Shot Bounce Distinction**

**Problem**: Slight bounce-back on made shots classified as rim bounce (miss)

**Solution**: Distinguish between strong rim bounce vs slight deflection

**Implementation**:
```
Current: Any upward movement â†’ rim bounce
New: Require significant upward movement (>20px) AND consistency
```

**Enhanced Rim Bounce Detection**:
- Require `upward_movement > 20px` (was 15px)
- Require `upward_consistency > 0.6` (was 0.5)
- If both not met â†’ Don't classify as rim bounce
- This allows slight deflections on made shots

**Expected Impact**: Fix 3-5 "steep_entry_bounce_back" cases

---

### **Phase 2: Fix Missedâ†’Made Errors (31 cases)**

#### **Improvement 2.1: Enhance Steep Entry Rim Detection**

**Problem**: Steep entry (>40Â°) with high overlap classified as made, but these hit rim

**Solution**: Improve rim bounce detection for steep entries

**Implementation**:
```
Current: entry_angle >= 40Â° â†’ classified as made (if 3+ frames at 100%)
New: For steep entries, require additional validation
```

**Decision Logic Modification**:
- If `entry_angle >= 40Â°` AND `frames_with_100_percent >= 3`:
  - **ALWAYS** check rim bounce confidence first
  - If `rim_bounce_confidence > 0.4` â†’ MISSED
  - If `rim_bounce_confidence < 0.4`:
    - Require strong downward continuation (downward_consistency > 0.8)
    - Require significant downward movement (>30px)
    - If both not met â†’ MISSED (likely rim hit)
    - If both met â†’ MADE (clean steep shot)

**Expected Impact**: Fix 15-18 of 22 "perfect_overlap_steep_entry" cases

---

#### **Improvement 2.2: Improve Post-Hoop Trajectory Analysis for Rim Hits**

**Problem**: Rim hits can have strong downward movement initially, then bounce

**Solution**: Analyze longer post-hoop trajectory window

**Implementation**:
```
Current: Analyzes 2-3 frames after overlap
New: Extend analysis window to 5-7 frames after overlap
```

**Enhanced Post-Hoop Analysis**:
- Track ball position for longer after hoop interaction
- Detect "deceleration + reversal" pattern (rim hit signature)
- If downward movement but then stops/slows â†’ likely rim hit (MISSED)
- If downward movement continues consistently â†’ likely made (MADE)

**Expected Impact**: Fix 5-7 "perfect_overlap_layup" and "perfect_overlap" cases

---

#### **Improvement 2.3: Add Overlap Pattern Analysis**

**Problem**: High overlap can occur on rim hits (ball sits on rim before bouncing)

**Solution**: Analyze overlap pattern, not just max/average

**Implementation**:
```
Current: Uses max_overlap and avg_overlap
New: Analyze overlap pattern for "peak then drop" (rim hit signature)
```

**Pattern Detection**:
- Rim hits often show: Peak overlap â†’ Gradual decrease â†’ Sudden drop
- Made shots often show: Peak overlap â†’ Sustained overlap â†’ Gradual decrease
- If overlap pattern shows sudden drop (>30% in 2 frames) â†’ likely rim hit

**Expected Impact**: Fix 4-6 additional cases

---

#### **Improvement 2.4: Stricter Fast Shot Validation**

**Problem**: Fast shots with 2 frames at 100% + downward continuation classified as made

**Solution**: Require additional validation for fast shots

**Implementation**:
```
Current: 2 frames at 100% + strong downward â†’ MADE
New: For fast shots, require additional factors
```

**Enhanced Fast Shot Logic**:
- If `frames_with_100_percent == 2` (fast shot):
  - Require: `downward_consistency >= 0.9` (was 0.8)
  - Require: `downward_movement >= 40px` (was just checking if >0)
  - Require: `rim_bounce_confidence < 0.2` (very low bounce risk)
  - Require: `entry_angle >= 30Â°` OR `entry_angle < 70Â°` (not too steep, not too shallow)
  - If all not met â†’ MISSED (likely rim hit)

**Expected Impact**: Fix 4-6 "fast_clean_swish" cases
