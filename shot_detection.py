Basketball Shot Detection and Analysis

This module provides comprehensive basketball shot detection, tracking, and classification
capabilities using YOLOv11 for object detection and trajectory analysis for shot outcomes.

Features:
- Real-time basketball and hoop detection
- Shot trajectory tracking
- Made/missed shot classification with confidence scoring
- JSON logging of all shots and classifications
- Overlay display with shot counters
